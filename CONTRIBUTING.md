# Contributing

This Dockerfile is for anybody who wants to use Ansible in Docker.

We gladly accept any contributions: fixing typos, glitches, bugs, technical enhancements and new features.

For technical enhancements and new features, please first have a look at the [current issues](https://github.com/akeneo/docker-molecule-gce/issues).
There may already be one, with details and ideas on how to implement it. You are welcome to pick it and propose a pull request if you'd like.

If it does not already exist, please take the time to first open an issue, to describe and discuss what you want to do, it will ease the merge of your pull request.
